<h2>Note</h2>
<p>As of 2005/12/30, this documentation is a bit outdated. I'll try to refresh it now that the API
is stabilized...</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As <a
 href="http://www.lehuen.com/nicolas/index.php/2005/02/14/36-james-tauber-updated-python-trie-implementation">promised</a>,
I've released a very preliminary version of pytst, a <a
 href="http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/ternarySearchTree.html">Ternary
Search Tree</a> (TST or trie)
implementation in C++ with a Python interface (built with <a
 href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>).
Download it <a href="http://nicolas.lehuen.com/download/pytst/">here</a>
if you dare !</p>
<p>Basically, it behaves like a
dictionary, but the keys can only be plain strings (sorry, not Unicode
strings yet). So why bother ? Because TSTs are a lot smarter than
dictionaries when it comes to :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prefix-matching : find the
longest entry in the TST which is a prefix to a given string. Handy for
things like scanners, <a
 href="http://www.myelin.co.nz/post/2005/2/28/#200502281">url
matchers</a> and so on.</li>
  <li>Scanning (corollary of the
previous one) : using the <a
 href="http://www-sr.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/%7Ebuehler/AC/AC.html">Aho-Corasick</a>
algorithm, you can implement pretty efficient scanners with a TST. The
good thing it that it can scale up to tens of thousands of entries and
still perform well.</li>
  <li>Spelling correctors : find a
set of entries which spelling is close to a given string. The distance
used is the <a href="http://www.merriampark.com/ld.htm">Levenshtein</a>
distance.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been using this package
in production for nearly a year now, without any problem (except a
surprise due to SWIG directors when I switched to Python 2.4, but this
is fixed now). I release this under the LGPL. Incidentally, this is my
first release under a license, up until now I was pretty much releasing
my dirty works in the public domain where it could safely be ignored
:). I am NOT satisfied with the packaging (especially the tests), the
code layout (it's been so long I had not been writing C++ that I forgot
a whole bunch of coding conventions) and so on, but I decided to
release this as is, and see what happens.</p>
<h2>Requirements and installation</h2>
First of all, get the files in the <a
 href="http://nicolas.lehuen.com/download/pytst/">download</a>
directory. If
you're lucky, there is a binary installer right for you environment (I
usually provide builds for Win32). If not, you're going to build the
module from the sources.<br>
<br>
pytst is a standard Python module, with a classic <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">setup.py install</span>
installation procedure. However, the native part of the module is
written in C++, so your mileage may vary. I have successfully built the
module on those environments :<br>
<ul>
  <li>Python 2.3 + MinGW (GCC
3.4.x) + Windows XP. See <a
 href="http://sebsauvage.net/python/mingw.html">here</a>
for more information on building native modules in this environment.</li>
  <li>Python 2.3 + GCC 3.3.x under
Cygwin + Windows XP.</li>
  <li>Python 2.4 + Microsoft
Visual Studio 2003 + Windows XP. Theoretically, using the free <a
 href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/">Microsoft
Visual C++ Toolkit 2003</a> should
be possible, following <a
 href="http://www.vrplumber.com/programming/mstoolkit/">those
instructions</a>.</li>
</ul>
If you manage to build pytst on any other environment, send me a mail
so that I can add it to this list ! Even better, we could add the
binaries to the downloads directory.<br>
<h2>Running the tests</h2>
Well, for now, the test are really crappy. I only have one script using
<span style="font-family: monospace;">unittest</span>, the other ones
don't say anything&nbsp; about the test
passing or failing. So for now, forget about running the test and go
straight to the...<br>
<h2>Ternary Search Tree crash
course</h2>
OK, so first, the basics :<br>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import tst<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = tst.TST()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t['foo']='bar'<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print t['foo']<br>bar<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print t['fo']<br>None<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t['foo']='baz'<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print t['foo']<br>baz<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print t[1]<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br> File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?<br> File "tst.py", line 354, in __getitem__<br> def __getitem__(*args): return _tst.TST___getitem__(*args)<br>TypeError: argument number 2: a 'char *' is expected, 'int(1)' is received<br></pre>
A TST instance behaves a bit like a Python <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">dict</span>,
but the keys can only be
strings, more precisely <span style="font-family: monospace;">str</span>
instances. Sorry, Unicode is not supported now, mostly because I
haven't found a way yet to have SWIG handle Unicode. If&nbsp; you
want
to use Unicode strings as keys, you have to consistently encode them
before storing them, preferably in UTF8 since it has the nice property
of not breaking the measurement of Levenshtein distances :<br>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import tst<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = tst.TST()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t[u'caf&eacute;'.encode('UTF8')]='java'<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print t[u'caf&eacute;'.encode('UTF8')]<br>java<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print t['caf\xc3\xa9']<br>java<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print t[u'caf&eacute;']<br><span
 style="font-style: italic;">(the process dies unexpectedly)<br></span></pre>
Talk about a crash course (wink wink, nudge nudge). Oh, yes, it's
dirty, but the nice thing about the process being killed is that it
saves you from the mess that would result of mixing byte strings and
Unicode strings in the same TST.<br>
<br>
So, what have we learned so far ?
pytst is a kind of dictionary, which handles string keys only, and
crash in a not so nice way when given Unicode strings. However, if you
read the introduction carefuly, you know that there is more to ternary
search trees than this.<br>
<h2>Using a TST to tokenize a
string<br>
</h2>
The first usage you can make of a ternary search tree is to use it to
tokenize a string. Why would you use a TST when you could use one of
the thousand lexers you can find on the Internet ? Well, try building a
ruleset for your favorite lexer with a thousand different token
definitions. Now try this with ten thousands, a hundred thousands, a
million token definition. The lexer will explode, whereas a TST will
not.<br>
<br>
Clearly, the features of the TST scanning algorithm are much less
flexible (don't try to compare them to what you can do with regular
expressions, for example), but it scales a lot well. Why would you want
to handle a million different token definition ? Well, that's up to
you, but DNA sequences parsing comes to mind.<br>
<br>
How does the scanning algorithm scales ? Well, like the <a
 href="http://www-sr.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/%7Ebuehler/AC/AC.html">Aho-Corasick</a>
algorithm. The algorithm reads each character from the input string
only once, then does its little dance within the TST data structures.
Believe me, this is fast, <a
 href="http://www.lehuen.com/nicolas/index.php/2005/04/06/48-pytst-performance">as
described here</a>.<br>
<br>
Now let's see a little bit of code. You initialize the TST with all the
tokens you are looking for, then launch the scan :<br>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import tst<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = tst.TST()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t['1234']='token 1'<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t['123456']='token 2'<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t['45678']='token 3'<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t['5678910']='token 4'<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; result = t.scan('1234561234567891012345',tst.TupleListAction())<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print result<br>[('123456', 6, 'token 2'), ('123456', 6, 'token 2'), ('78910', -5, None), ('1234', 4, 'token 1'), ('5', -1, None)]</pre>
The tokenizing algorithm is greedy : it will try to produce the
longest&nbsp; tokens available, consuming the characters as they
come.
That's why the token 4 was not produced in the above example : the
sequence <span style="font-family: monospace;">'123456'</span>
was
already consumed. This may be a big limitation for some usages ; it
means that the patterns you are looking for can only be recognized from
their prefix, not from their suffix. ( Maybe that's not how ribosoms
parse the DNA (more exactly, the <a
 href="http://www.cytochemistry.net/Cell-biology/ribosome.htm">mRNA</a>),
so this limitation may render the algorithm useless for DNA sequence
analysis, after all. Anyway... )<br>
<br>
<h2>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">TupleListAction</span>
callback class</h2>
What about <span style="font-family: monospace;">tst.TupleListAction()</span>
? This is our first example of giving a callback to the TST so that it
can perform an action each time a match is found. TupleListAction just
accumulate all the matches in a list, each match being stored as a
tuple. The first item of the tuple is either a key from the TST, or a
substring from the scanned string. If it is a key, this means a match
has been found, so the second item is the key length and the third item
is the object associated to the key in the TST. If the first item is a
substring from the scanned string, the second item is the substring
length with a negative sign, and the third item is None. Typically, the
result object can be used like this :<br>
<pre><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; for matched_string, matched_length, matched_object in result:<br>... 	if matched_length&gt;0:<br>... 		sys.stdout.write(matched_object)<br>... 	else:<br>... 		sys.stdout.write(print matched_string)<br>... else:<br>... 	print<br>token 2token 278910token 15<br><br></pre>
Here you are, you have built a transcriber that could handle millions
of transcribing rules very efficiently.&nbsp; Well, that's not
totally
true,
since you first have to parse the string to obtain a list of tokens,
then iterate on the list of tokens to write something. Why not produce
the output while we're scanning the input string ? That's why the tst
module has other action callbacks.<br>
<h2>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">CallableAction</span>
callback class</h2>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; def mycallback(key,length,obj):<br>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if length&gt;0:<br>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sys.stdout.write(obj)<br>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else:<br>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sys.stdout.write(key)<br>...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; def myresult():<br>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print<br>...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.scan('1234561234567891012345',tst.CallableAction(mycallback,myresult))<br>token 2token 278910token 15</pre>
The <span style="font-family: monospace;">CallableAction</span>
callback class allows you to pass two callables : the first one is
called for each match or non-match, with exactly the same arguments as
the one that were found in the tuples built by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TupleListAction</span>.
The second one
is called at the end of the scan, without any arguments. Its return
value is returned by the <span style="font-family: monospace;">scan</span>
method, which allows you to write shortcuts like :<br>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Counter(object):<br>... 	def __init__(self):<br>... 		self.counter = 0 <br>... 	def hit(self,key,length,obj):<br>... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	if length&gt;0:<br>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 		self.counter += 1<br>... 	def result(self):<br>... 		return 'I found %i hits'%self.counter<br>...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Counter()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print t.scan('1234561234567891012345',tst.CallableAction(c.hit,c.result))<br>I found 3 hits<br></pre>
You can even subclass <span style="font-family: monospace;">tcc.CallableAction</span>
for more compacity. For example, you could reimplement <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">TupleListAction</span>
like this :<br>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyTupleListAction(tst.CallableAction):<br>... 	def __init__(self):<br>... 		tst.CallableAction.__init__(self,self.callback,self.result)<br>... 		self.list = []<br>... 	def callback(self,key,length,obj):<br>... 		self.list.append((key,length,obj))<br>... 	def result(self):<br>... 		return self.list<br>...<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print t.scan('1234561234567891012345',MyTupleListAction())<br>[('123456', 6, 'token 2'), ('123456', 6, 'token 2'), ('78910', -5, None), ('1234', 4, 'token 1'), ('5', -1, None)]<br></pre>
Of course this version is less efficient than the original <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">tst.TupleListAction</span>
which saves
one or two layer of wrappers by going directly from the TST C++ API to
the Python C API.<br>

callback classes</h2>
